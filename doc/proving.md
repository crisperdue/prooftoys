## Building proofs with Mathtoys

Mathematical reasoning is based on rules.  The rules describe what you
can correctly deduce from mathematical statements that are already
known to be true.

Using just a handful of rules for mathematical reasoning, you can
build proofs with Mathtoys.  Most of these rules work with two steps
and produce a third step as a consequence of the two inputs.

Some rules need an equation as one input.  The equation may equate
ordinary values such as numbers, as in an equation such as x + y = y +
x.  It may equate truth values, as in T == not F.  In fact it may
equate values of any kind handled by Mathtoys.

Other rules work with any statement already known to be true, and do
not require that the statement has the form of an equation.

Either way, the equation or proved fact can be known true just under
certain conditions.  The rules still work when there are conditions.
