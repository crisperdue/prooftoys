<h2>Background</h2>

Functions, explain!<br>
Truth function / predicate / property, also explain?

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Let's look at an example mathematical world through some pictures.

This world is shown as a circle.  The world has some things in it,
each of those things appearing at a particular spot in the picture.

It has some sets of things, in particular set A, set B, and set C.
Each of these sets is shown as a circle, or part of a circle within
the circle for the world, shaded with a particular color and pattern.
Each set is labeled with its name.

Each of these sets contains the things inside its shaded circle or
part circle, but not the things outside in the white area.

Instead of saying a thing is in set A, we can say that the predicate A
is true of the thing, or we can say it has property A.  These are just
different ways of describing the same situation.

In our version of mathematical notation we are going to write
<code>A x</code> or <code>(A x)</code>. to mean that A is true for x.

<canvas id=canvasB width=210 height=210></canvas>
<canvas id=canvasC width=210 height=210></canvas>

<h2>Negation -- "not"</h2>

We may want to talk about the things that are not in a set, one where
the predicate is not true.
<p>
In the next set of pictures the shaded areas represent the set of
things not in one of our sets.  The first one shows the set of things
not in set A.  The second one shows things not in set B, and the third
shows things not in set C.
<p>
If the predicate A is not true for a thing x, in our notation we write
<code>not (A x)</code> or <code>(not (A x))</code>.  Of course we can
also read this as saying that x is not in set A.
<p>
We commonly call a statement like <code>(not (A x))</code> the negation of
a statement <code>(A x)</code>.  The negated statement is true of all
the things where the original statement <code>(A x)</code> is false.
<p>
The shaded areas in the next pictures show the things where
<code>(not (A x))</code> is true, where <code>(not (B x))</code> is
true, and finally where <code>(not (C x))</code> is true.

<h2>Disjunction -- "or"</h2>

Suppose you thinking what to have for lunch, and decide it must either
be tasty or cheap.
