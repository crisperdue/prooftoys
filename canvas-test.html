<h2>Background</h2>

Functions, explain!<br>
Truth function / predicate / property, also explain?

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Let's look at an example mathematical world through some pictures.
This world is shown as a circle.  The world has some things in it,
each of those things appearing at a particular spot in the picture.
<p>
It has some sets of things, in particular set A, set B, and set C.
Each of these sets is shown as a circle, or part of a circle within
the circle for the world, shaded with a particular color and pattern.
Each set is labeled with its name.
Each of these sets contains the things inside its shaded circle or
part circle, but not the things outside in the white area.
<p>
Instead of saying a thing is in set A, we can say that the predicate A
is true of the thing, or we can say it has property A.  These are just
different ways of describing the same situation.
<p>
In our version of mathematical notation we are going to write
<code>A x</code> or <code>(A x)</code>. to mean that A is true for x.

<p>
<canvas id=canvasA width=210 height=210></canvas>
<canvas id=canvasB width=210 height=210></canvas>
<canvas id=canvasC width=210 height=210></canvas>

<h2>Negation -- "not"</h2>

We may want to talk about the things that are not in a set, one where
the predicate is not true.
<p>
In the next set of pictures the shaded areas represent the set of
things not in one of our sets.  The first one shows the set of things
not in set A.  The second one shows things not in set B, and the third
shows things not in set C.
<p>
If the predicate A is not true for a thing x, in our notation we write
<code>not (A x)</code> or <code>(not (A x))</code>.  Of course we can
also read this as saying that x is not in set A.
<p>
We commonly call a statement like <code>(not (A x))</code> the negation of
a statement <code>(A x)</code>.  The negated statement is true of all
the things where the original statement <code>(A x)</code> is false.
<p>
The lime green areas in the next pictures show where
<code>(not (A x))</code> is true, where <code>(not (B x))</code> is
true, and finally where <code>(not (C x))</code> is true.

<h2>Disjunction -- "or"</h2>

Suppose you are considering what to have for lunch, and decide it must
either be delicious or easy.  In the first picture let circle D
represent things that are delicious and circle E represent things that
are easy.  The combined area then represents things that are delicious
or easy.  We can write that a thing x is "delicious or easy"
as <code>((D x) or (E x))</code>.  Everything in the parts of the
picture that are shaded satisfy this statement.
<p>
<canvas id=canvasOrDE width=210 height=210></canvas>
<canvas id=canvasOrDE2 class=hidden width=210 height=210></canvas>

<h2>Conjunction -- "and"</h2>

Suppose you are feeling more picky about your lunch, and decide you
want something that is both delicious and easy.  Only things in
both of the circles fit this description.  This is the small shaded
area.  We write it as
<code>((D x) and (E x))</code>.
<p>
<canvas id=canvasAndDE width=210 height=210></canvas>
<canvas class=hidden id=canvasAnd width=210 height=210></canvas>
<canvas class=hidden id=canvasAll width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
What if there is nothing that is both easy and delicious?  A picture
for that situation could like this:
<canvas id=canvasAndDE2 width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
The picture has no shaded area because region D and region do not
overlap.  And if that really is your requirement, in this scenario
there is no lunch for you!
