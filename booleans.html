<h2>Introduction</h2>

Let's look at an example mathematical world through some pictures.
This world is shown as a circle.  The world has various items in it,
each of those items having a particular spot in the picture.
<p>
Sets of items are shown as a circle, part of a circle, or other region
within the circle for the world, shaded with a particular color and
pattern.  Each set is labeled with a name such as A, B, or C.  Each
contains the items inside its shaded circle or part circle, but
nothing ouside of that.
<p>
Instead of saying a thing is in set A, we can say that the predicate A
is true of the thing, we can say it has property A, or the proposition
A is true of it.  These are just different ways of describing the same
situation.
<p>
In our version of mathematical notation we are going to write
<code>(A x)</code> to mean that A is true for x (or x is in A).

<p>
<canvas id=canvasA width=210 height=210></canvas>
<canvas id=canvasB width=210 height=210></canvas>
<canvas id=canvasC width=210 height=210></canvas>

<h2>Negation -- "not"</h2>

We may want to talk about the items that are not in a set, ones that
do not have the property.
<p>
In the next group of pictures the shaded areas still represent the set
of items having properties A, B, or C, but the solid colored areas
represent items not having the property: in the first one items things
not in set A, in the second one items not in set B, and in the third
items not in set C.
<p>
If the predicate A is not true for an item x, in our notation we write
<code>not (A x)</code> or <code>(not (A x))</code>.  Of course we can
also read this as saying that x does not have property A or is not in
the set A.
<p>
We commonly call a statement like <code>(not (A x))</code> the negation of
a statement <code>(A x)</code>.  The negated statement is true of all
the things where the original statement <code>(A x)</code> is false.
<p>
So the blue shaded areas in the next pictures show where
<code>(not (A x))</code> is true, where <code>(not (B x))</code> is
true, and finally where <code>(not (C x))</code> is true.

<h2>Functions and truth values</h2>

<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>
In mathematics a function named <code>f</code> is often defined
with a statement like this:

<blockquote>
<code>f(x) = x + 1</code>
</blockquote>
In our notation:
<blockquote>
<code>(f x) = x + 1</code><br>
</blockquote>

So:
<blockquote>
<code>
(f 0) = 1<br>
(f 1) = 2<br>
(f 2) = 3
</code>
</blockquote>

and so on.  The function produces a value given an input value.  A
function can have more than one input.  The addition function
(<code>+</code>) for example takes two numbers as input and gives a
number as its result, as in <code>3 + 5 = 8</code>.

<h4>True and false as values</h4>
<p>
In the examples so far there are mathematical statements such
as <code>(A x)</code> and <code>(not (A x))</code>.  In
these, <code>A</code>, <code>f</code>, and <code>not</code> represent
functions.  The function <code>f</code> produces an integer given an
integer.
<p>
In mathematical logic there are also values <code>true</code>
and <code>false</code>, known as <i>truth values</i>.  The
function <code>A</code> produces a value of <code>true</code>
or <code>false</code>.  The input of the function <code>not</code> is
a truth value and its result is also a truth value.  These are often
referred to as boolean values in honor of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole">George Boole</a>,
a pioneer in the development of these concepts.
<p>
Since there are only two truth values we can describe the
function <code>not</code> with a table that shows its value for the
possible inputs.  The table entries where the value is false are
shaded in gray, and the entries where the value is true are shaded
with blue lines to match the pictures and highlight the differences
visually.
<p>
<table class=binaryTruthTable>
 <tr>
  <th><th><th><b>not X</b>
 <tr>
  <th rowspan=2><b>X</b>
  <th>false<td class=truthy>
 <tr>
  <th>true<td class=falsy>
</table>
<p>
So <code>(not false) = true</code> and <code>(not true) = false</code>.

<h2>Disjunction -- "or"</h2>
<p>
Suppose you are considering what to have for lunch, and decide it must
either be delicious or easy.  In the first picture let circle D
represent things that are delicious and circle E represent things that
are easy.  The combined area then represents things that are delicious
or easy.  We can write that a thing x is "delicious or easy"
as <code>((D x) or (E x))</code>.  Everything in the parts of the
picture that are shaded satisfy this statement.
<p>
The shaded part of the second picture also represents things that are
delicious or easy, this time using the same shading for all of them
instead of separate shadings for D and E.
<p>
<canvas id=canvasOrDE width=210 height=210></canvas>
<canvas id=canvasOrDE2 width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
The truth tables for binary operators are organized with a row for
each value of the first input and a column for each value of the
second argument.  The truth table for <code>D or E</code> is:
<p>
<table class=binaryTruthTable>
 <tr>
  <th colspan=2 rowspan=2 style="text-align: center"><!-- <b>or</b> -->
  <th colspan=2 style="text-align: center"><b>E</b>
 <tr><th>false<th>true
 <tr><th rowspan=2><b>D</b><th>false<td class=falsy><td class=truthy>
 <tr>               <th>true<td class=truthy><td class=truthy>
</table>
<p>
So for example <code>(false or true) = true</code>.

<h2>Conjunction -- "and"</h2>

Suppose you are feeling more picky about your lunch, and decide you
want something that is both delicious and easy.  Only things in
both of the circles fit this description.  This is the small shaded
area.  We write it as
<code>((D x) and (E x))</code>.
<p>
<canvas id=canvasAndDE width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
The truth table for <code>D and E</code> is:
<p>
<table class=binaryTruthTable>
 <tr>
  <th colspan=2 rowspan=2 style="text-align: center"><!-- <b>and</b> -->
  <th colspan=2 style="text-align: center"><b>E</b>
 <tr><th>false<th>true
 <tr><th rowspan=2><b>D</b><th>false<td class=falsy><td class=falsy>
 <tr>               <th>true<td class=falsy><td class=truthy>
</table>
<p>
What if there is nothing that is both easy and delicious?  A picture
for that situation could like this:
<p>
<canvas id=canvasAndDE2 width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
The picture has no shaded area because region D and region do not
overlap; there is no part of the picture where D and E are both true.
If that really is your requirement, in this scenario there is no
possible lunch for you!

<h2>True statements</h2>
<p>
Mathematics is especially interested in statements that are true,
particularly statements that are true by mathematical reasoning, in
other words theorems.

<h3>Disjunctions -- "or"</h3>
<p>
As an example let's consider the statement that every number is either
less than 100 or greater than 10.  We could state this as
<code>x &lt; 100 or x &gt; 10</code>.  In the picture for this
statement all shaded areas represent cases where the statement is
true.
<p>
<canvas id=canvasOrAll width=210 height=210>
<p>
This picture shows everything in the world (all numbers) in one or
both of the groups, and shows that some numbers are in both groups.
<p>
A more conventional and more informative picture might show a number
line and the values having both of the properties, like this:
<p>
<canvas id=canvasArrow width=310 height=100>
<p>
The statement <code>x &lt; 100 or x &gt; 10</code> is true regardless
of the value of <code>x</code>.  In mathematics, if the truth of a
statement does not depend on the values of variables in it, it
is considered simply a true or valid statement.

<h3>Conjunctions -- "and"</h3>
<p>
To be true, both parts of a statement with "and" must also be true.
Any part not in one of the areas will not be in both.  Here is a
picture illustrating a statement <code>A and B</code> that is true,
where A and B are both true statements.
<p>
<canvas id=canvasAnd width=210 height=210></canvas>


<h3>Implication -- "implies"</h3>
<p>
Let's look at another typical kind of statement that has a logical
meaning, such as "all birds have wings".  We might also express
this as "if x is a bird then x has wings".  In our notation we can
write <code>(bird x) implies (wings x)</code> or alternatively
<code>bird x --> wings x</code>.
<p>
The picture below illustrates a scenario where the statement is true.
The area representing all things with wings entirely encloses the area
that represents all birds.  (In this picture there are also some
things with wings that are not birds, such as bats in the real world.)
<p>
<canvas id=canvasImplies width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
Any picture of this kind where one area encloses another (or occupies
the same area) illustrates a true statement of this kind.  But is
there a system for shading pictures like this so they are completely
shaded exactly when the statement is true?  It turns out there is.
<p>
Let's consider a picture where the statement is <i>not</i> always
true, like this:
<p>
<canvas id=canvasNotImplies width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
It is clear right away which part of the picture makes the statement
not always true -- the part of the "birds" circle outside the "wings"
area.
<p>
Anything in the picture that is not a bird does not affect the truth
of the statement.  If something is not a bird, it does not affect
whether this statement about birds is true.  <i>If every part of the
picture is either in the "wings" circle or not in the "birds" circle,
the statement is true.</i>  Here is a truth table for the
relationship:
<p>
<table class=binaryTruthTable>
 <tr>
  <th colspan=2 rowspan=2 style="text-align: center">
  <th colspan=2 style="text-align: center"><b>wings</b>
 <tr><th>false<th>true
 <tr><th rowspan=2><b>bird</b><th>false<td class=truthy><td class=truthy>
 <tr>               <th>true<td class=falsy><td class=truthy>
</table>
<p>
Here are two picture as before, but with shading to show the areas
where the statement <code>bird x --&gt; wings x</code> is true.
First one where it is true everywhere:
<p>
<canvas id=birdWingsTrue width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
And now one where the statement is not true everywhere:
<p>
<canvas id=birdWingsFalse width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
The birds without wings are represented by the small white area with
no shading.
<p>
So we have found that it is possible to define a
function <code>implies</code> (alternatively <code>--&gt;</code>) that
enables us to make statements that say one thing implies another.  It
works like <code>and</code> and <code>or</code>, taking two boolean
values as inputs and producing a boolean (<code>true</code>
or <code>false</code>) result.

<h4>Vacuous statements</h4>
<p>
Some peculiar situations lead to results that may seem a bit strange.
What if we say that all birds larger than elephants can fly in outer
space?  If there are no birds larger than elephants in our world, in
mathematics this is considered a true statement!  The reason it is
considered true is that indeed there are <i>no examples that break
the rule</i>, that is no birds that are larger than elephants and
cannot fly in outer space!
<p>
In situations where there is nothing with a property <code>A</code>,
it is true to say that <code>A</code> implies anything at all, no
matter how silly or impossible.  Mathematicians recognize that this is
a strange situation and refer to such as statements as <i>vacuously
true</i>, meaning true but useless because there can never be a
counterexample and it doesn't matter what the conclusion of the
statement is.
