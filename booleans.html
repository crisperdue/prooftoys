<h2><a name=introduction></a>Introduction</h2>

<h4>Background</h4>
<p>
Though the system described here is modern, it supports the kinds of
reasoning used by the ancient Greek mathematicians and philosophers,
so it is known by mathematicians as a form of <i>classical</i> logic.
In the last 100 years or so other varieties of logic have been
created, but classical logic is by far the best known and widely used
kind in textbooks and by working mathematicians.  It is also
considered <i>functional</i> in that it treats functions as a
fundamental concept.

<h4>About the pictures</h4>
<p>
Let's look at an example mathematical world through some pictures.
This world is shown as a circle.  The world has various items in it,
each of those items having a particular spot in the picture.
<p>
Sets of items are shown as a circle, part of a circle, or other region
of this world, shaded with a particular color and pattern.  Each set
is labeled with a name.  Each contains the items inside its shaded
circle or part circle, but nothing ouside of that.  In the diagrams
below, areas where some statement is true are generally colored.
Areas where a statement is <i>not true</i> are usually white or gray.
<p>
In our version of mathematical notation we are going to write
<code>(green x)</code> to mean that x is green, <code>(blue x)</code>
to mean that x is blue, and so on.
<p>
Mathematical writing, instead of saying a point of a picture is blue,
or has the property of being blue, often says it is a member of the
set of points that are blue.  In mathematics, properties are also
often referred to as <i>predicates</i>.  These are all just different
ways of describing the same situation.

<h2><a name=functions></a>Functions and truth values</h2>

<h4>Functions</h4>
<p>
In mathematics a function named <code>f</code> is often defined
with a statement like this:

<blockquote>
<code>f(x) = x + 1</code>
</blockquote>
In our notation:
<blockquote>
<code>(f x) = x + 1</code><br>
</blockquote>

So:
<blockquote>
<code>
(f 0) = 1<br>
(f 1) = 2<br>
(f 2) = 3
</code>
</blockquote>

and so on.  A function produces a value given an input value.  A
function can have more than one input.  The addition function
(<code>+</code>) for example takes two numbers as input and gives a
number as its result, as in <code>3 + 5 = 8</code>.  The
function <code>f</code> takes a number as input and produces a number.

<h4>True and false as values</h4>
<p>
In mathematical logic there are values <code>true</code>
and <code>false</code>, known as <i>truth values</i>.  These are often
referred to as boolean values in honor of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole">George Boole</a>,
a pioneer in the development of these ideas.
<p>
When we write something like <code>(green x)</code>, 
<code>(blue x)</code>, or <code>(yellow x)</code>, the words
<code>green</code>, <code>blue</code>, and <code>yellow</code>
represent functions that produce a value of <code>true</code>
or <code>false</code>.  The function <code>blue</code> for example
produces a value of <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> depending
on whether its input is blue or not.
<p>
<i>In other words, predicates are functions that produce values that
are <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</i>

<h2><a name=negation></a>Negation -- "not"</h2>
<p>
Negation provides a way to talk about items that do not have a certain
property, ones that are not in a certain set, or where the value of a
predicate is <code>false</code>.  In our logic, these are all just
different ways of expressing the same idea.
<p>
The next group of pictures illustrate negation.  The first picture in
this group goes with the first picture in the original group, and
similarly for the second and third pictures.  Here the solid gray
areas represent the parts of the pictures in the first group that are
green, or blue, or yellow.  The area with the orange stripes in the
first picture of this group represents areas that are not green in the
first picture of the original group.  In the second one it represents
areas not blue in the second original, and in the third picture areas
that are not yellow in the third original.
<p>
<canvas id=canvasNotA width=210 height=210></canvas>
<canvas id=canvasNotB width=210 height=210></canvas>
<canvas id=canvasNotC width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
Putting it another way, each point in each of these pictures is in a
colored area if the point is <i>not</i> in a colored area in the
original picture.  So we can treat <code>not</code> as a function that
takes <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> as its input and
produces a value of <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.  We can
define the behavior of this function with a table, like this:
<p>
<table class=binaryTruthTable>
 <tr>
  <th><th><th><b>not X</b>
 <tr>
  <th rowspan=2><b>X</b>
  <th>false<td class=truthy>
 <tr>
  <th>true<td class=falsy>
</table>
<p>
To use the table, look up the row labeled with the value of the input
"X".  The value of the function is in that row under "not X".
So <code>(not false) = true</code> and <code>(not true) =
false</code>.
<p>
The table entries where the value is false are shaded in gray, and the
entries where the value is true are shaded with blue lines to
highlight the differences visually.  This kind of table that shows the
truth value produced by true or false inputs to a function is called
a <i>truth table</i>.  We will use this color scheme in other truth
tables as well.
<p>
In our notation we write <code>not (A x)</code> or <code>(not (A
x))</code>.  Of course we can also read this as saying that the
predicate A is not true for x, or that x is not in the set A.  In
mathematics a statement like <code>(not (A x))</code> is commonly
called the negation of a statement <code>(A x)</code>.  The negated
statement is true of all the things where the original
statement <code>(A x)</code> is false.
<p>
So the colored areas in these pictures show where
<code>(not (green x))</code> is true, where <code>(not (blue x))</code> is
true, and finally where <code>(not (yellow x))</code> is true.

<h2><a name=disjunction></a>Disjunction -- "or"</h2>
<p>
Suppose you are considering what to have for lunch, and decide it must
either be delicious or easy.  In the first picture let circle D
represent things that are delicious and circle E represent things that
are easy.  The combined area then represents things that are delicious
or easy.  We can write that a thing x is "delicious or easy"
as <code>((D x) or (E x))</code>.  Everything in the parts of the
picture that are shaded satisfy this statement.
<p>
The shaded part of the second picture also represents things that are
delicious or easy, this time using the same shading for all of them
instead of separate shadings for D and E.
<p>
<canvas id=canvasOrDE width=210 height=210></canvas>
<canvas id=canvasOrDE2 width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
Each point this is in the yellow area or the green area of the first
picture is in the blue area of the second picture.  Once again we can
invent a function that describes this situation, and will call it
<code>or</code>.  This is called a <i>binary function</i> because it
has two inputs.  The inputs are truth values and the result is also a
truth value.
<p>
<table class=binaryTruthTable>
 <tr>
  <th colspan=2 rowspan=2 style="text-align: center"><!-- <b>or</b> -->
  <th colspan=2 style="text-align: center"><b>E</b>
 <tr><th>false<th>true
 <tr><th rowspan=2><b>D</b><th>false<td class=falsy><td class=truthy>
 <tr>               <th>true<td class=truthy><td class=truthy>
</table>
<p>
This truth table is organized with a row for each value of the first
input and a column for each value of the second inpu.  The value of
the function is in the row for the value of the first input and the
column for the value of the second input.  So for example <code>(false
or true) = true</code>.

<h2><a name=conjunction></a>Conjunction -- "and"</h2>
<p>
Suppose you are feeling more picky about your lunch, and decide you
want something that is both delicious and easy.  Only things in
both of the circles fit this description.  This is the small shaded
area.  We write it as
<code>((D x) and (E x))</code>.
<p>
<canvas id=canvasAndDE width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
Once again, at each point "x" in the picture,
<code>(D x) and (E x)</code> is true exactly when <code>(D x)</code>
is true and <code>(E x)</code> is also true.  So we can invent a
function <code>and</code> and define it with a truth table:
<p>
<table class=binaryTruthTable>
 <tr>
  <th colspan=2 rowspan=2 style="text-align: center"><!-- <b>and</b> -->
  <th colspan=2 style="text-align: center"><b>E</b>
 <tr><th>false<th>true
 <tr><th rowspan=2><b>D</b><th>false<td class=falsy><td class=falsy>
 <tr>               <th>true<td class=falsy><td class=truthy>
</table>
<p>
What if there is nothing that is both easy and delicious?  A picture
for that situation could like this:
<p>
<canvas id=canvasAndDE2 width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
The picture has no shaded area because region D and region do not
overlap; there is no part of the picture where D and E are both true.
If that really is your requirement, in this scenario there is no
possible lunch for you!
<p>
The function defined by the truth table for <code>and</code> is the
same in any picture.  It determines whether two statements are both
true in any situation.

<h2><a name=statements></a>Statements that are always true</h2>
<p>
Mathematics is especially interested in statements that are true, by
mathematical reasoning, in other words theorems.  If a mathematical
statement has variables in it, the statement is a true one if it is
true regardless of the values of the variables.

<h3><a name=trueDisjunctions></a>Disjunctions</h3>
<p>
As an example let's consider the statement that every number is either
less than 100 or greater than 10.  We could state this as
<code>x &lt; 100 or x &gt; 10</code>.  In the picture for this
statement all shaded areas represent cases where the statement is
true.
<p>
<canvas id=canvasOrAll width=210 height=210>
<p>
This picture shows everything in the world (all numbers) in one or
both of the groups, and shows that some numbers are in both groups.
<p>
A more conventional and more informative picture might show a number
line and the values having both of the properties, like this:
<p>
<canvas id=canvasArrow width=310 height=100>
<p>
The statement <code>x &lt; 100 or x &gt; 10</code> is true regardless
of the value of <code>x</code>.  In mathematics, if the truth of a
statement does not depend on the values of variables in it, it
is considered simply a true or valid statement.

<h3><a name=trueConjunctions></a>Conjunctions</h3>
<p>
To be true, both parts of a statement with "and" must also be true.
Any part not in one of the areas will not be in both.  Here is a
picture illustrating a statement <code>A and B</code> that is true,
where A and B are both true statements.
<p>
<canvas id=canvasAnd width=210 height=210></canvas>


<h3><a name=trueConditionals></a>Conditionals, "all A are B"</h3>
<p>
Let's look at another typical kind of statement that has a logical
meaning, such as "all birds have wings".  We might also express
this as "if x is a bird then x has wings".  In our notation we can
write <code>(bird x) implies (wings x)</code> or alternatively
<code>bird x --> wings x</code>.
<p>
The picture below illustrates a scenario where the statement is true.
The area representing all things with wings entirely encloses the area
that represents all birds.  There are also areas of the picture to
represent things with wings that are not birds, such as bats in the
real world.
<p>
<canvas id=canvasImplies width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
Any picture of this kind where one area encloses another (or occupies
the same area) illustrates a true statement of this kind.  But is
there a system for shading pictures like this so they are completely
shaded exactly when the statement is true?  It turns out there is.
<p>
Let's consider a picture where the statement is <i>not</i> always
true, like this:
<p>
<canvas id=canvasNotImplies width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
It is clear right away which part of the picture makes the statement
not always true -- the part of the "birds" circle outside the "wings"
area.
<p>
Anything in the picture that is not a bird does not affect the truth
of the statement.  If something is not a bird, it does not affect
whether this statement about birds is true.  If every part of the
picture is either in the "wings" circle or <b>not</b> in the "birds"
circle, the statement is true.

<h2><a name=implication></a>Implication -- "implies"</h2>
<p>
With this background we can see how to define one more function that
takes two truth values as inputs and produces true or false as its
value.  This function makes it simple to express ideas like "all birds
have wings" mathematically!  Here is its truth table:
<p>
<table class=binaryTruthTable>
 <tr>
  <th colspan=2 rowspan=2 style="text-align: center">
  <th colspan=2 style="text-align: center"><b>wings</b>
 <tr><th>false<th>true
 <tr><th rowspan=2><b>bird</b><th>false<td class=truthy><td class=truthy>
 <tr>               <th>true<td class=falsy><td class=truthy>
</table>
<p>
We call the function <code>implies</code>
(alternatively <code>--&gt;</code>), and it enables us to make
statements that say one thing implies another.
<p>
Here are two picture as before, but with shading to show the areas
where the expression <code>(bird x) --&gt; (wings x)</code>
has <code>true</code> as its value.  First one where it is true
everywhere:
<p>
<canvas id=birdWingsTrue width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
In this scenario all birds do indeed have wings so the function is
behaving as intended.  And now one where the statement is not true
everywhere:
<p>
<canvas id=birdWingsFalse width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
The birds without wings are represented by the small white area with
no shading.  This is exactly the area where the value of the
<code>implies</code> function is false.  In this scenario the
statement that all birds have wings is false, so the function
is indeed behaving as intended.

<h4>Vacuous statements</h4>
<p>
Some peculiar situations lead to results that may seem a bit strange.
What if we say that all birds larger than elephants can fly in outer
space?  If there are no birds larger than elephants in our world, in
mathematics this is considered a true statement!  It is considered
true is that indeed there are <i>no examples that break the rule</i>,
that is no birds that are larger than elephants and cannot fly in
outer space!  And in fact the <code>implies</code> function has the
value <code>true</code> everywhere.  The truth table entries in the
row where the first input is <code>false</code> both have the
value <code>true</code>, so if the there are no birds larger than
elephants, all of them can fly in outer space!
<p>
In situations where there is nothing with a property <code>A</code>,
it is true to say that <code>A</code> implies anything at all, no
matter how silly or impossible.  Mathematicians recognize that this is
a strange situation and refer to such as statements as <i>vacuously
true</i>, meaning true but useless because there can never be a
counterexample and it doesn't matter what the conclusion of the
statement is.
<p>
In fact things that do not exist can have contradictory properties.
For example (assuming all birds have wings) all wingless birds are
blue, and furthermore all wingless birds are green.  This is possible
only because these statements are vacuously true.
