<h2>True statements</h2>
<p>
Mathematics is especially interested in statements that are true,
particularly statements that are true by mathematical reasoning, in
other words theorems.
<p>
As an example let's consider the statement that every number is either
less than 100 or greater than 10.  We could state this as
<code>x &lt; 100 or x &gt; 10</code>.  A picture of the statement
might look like this:
<p>
<canvas id=canvasOrAll width=210 height=210>
<p>
This picture shows everything in the world (all numbers) in one or
both of the groups, and shows that some numbers are in both groups.
<p>
A more conventional and more informative picture might show a number
line and the values that satisfy both of the conditions, like this:
<p>
<canvas id=canvasArrow width=310 height=100>
<p>
In any case the statement <code>x &lt; 100 or x &gt; 10</code>
is true regardless of the value of <code>x</code>.  In mathematics a
statement like this that is true regardless of the values assigned to
its variables is considered a true statement.

<h2>Implication -- "implies"</h2>
<p>
Let's look at another typical kind of statement often seen in
mathematics, the sort like "all men are mortal".  In our notation we
can write <code>(man x) implies (mortal x)</code>.  We might also
express this as "if x is a man then x is mortal".
