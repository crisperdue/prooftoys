<h2>True statements</h2>
<p>
Mathematics is especially interested in statements that are true,
particularly statements that are true by mathematical reasoning, in
other words theorems.

<h3>Disjunctions -- "or"</h3>
<p>
As an example let's consider the statement that every number is either
less than 100 or greater than 10.  We could state this as
<code>x &lt; 100 or x &gt; 10</code>.  In the picture for this
statement all shaded areas represent cases where the statement is
true.
<p>
<canvas id=canvasOrAll width=210 height=210>
<p>
This picture shows everything in the world (all numbers) in one or
both of the groups, and shows that some numbers are in both groups.
<p>
A more conventional and more informative picture might show a number
line and the values having both of the properties, like this:
<p>
<canvas id=canvasArrow width=310 height=100>
<p>
The statement <code>x &lt; 100 or x &gt; 10</code> is true regardless
of the value of <code>x</code>.  In mathematics, if the truth of a
statement does not depend on the values of variables in it, it
is considered simply a true or valid statement.

<h3>Conjunctions -- "and"</h3>
<p>
To be true, both parts of a statement with "and" must also be true.
Any part not in one of the areas will not be in both.  Here is a
picture illustrating a statement <code>A and B</code> that is true,
where A and B are both true statements.
<p>
<canvas id=canvasAnd width=210 height=210></canvas>


<h3>Implication -- "implies"</h3>
<p>
Let's look at another typical kind of statement that has a logical
meaning, such as "all birds have wings".  We might also express
this as "if x is a bird then x has wings".  In our notation we can
write <code>(bird x) implies (wings x)</code> or alternatively
<code>bird x --> wings x</code>.
<p>
The picture below illustrates a scenario where the statement is true.
The area representing all things with wings entirely encloses the area
that represents all birds.  (In this picture there are also some
things with wings that are not birds, such as bats in the real world.)
<p>
<canvas id=canvasImplies width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
Any picture of this kind where one area encloses another (or occupies
the same area) illustrates a true statement of this kind.  But is
there a system for shading pictures like this so they are completely
shaded exactly when the statement is true?  It turns out there is.
<p>
Let's consider a picture where the statement is <i>not</i> always
true, like this:
<p>
<canvas id=canvasNotImplies width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
It is clear right away which part of the picture makes the statement
not always true -- the part of the "birds" circle outside the "wings"
area.
<p>
Anything in the picture that is not a bird does not affect the truth
of the statement.  If something is not a bird, it does not affect
whether this statement about birds is true.  <i>If every part of the
picture is either in the "wings" circle or not in the "birds" circle,
the statement is true.</i>  Here is a truth table for the
relationship:
<p>
<table class=truthTable>
 <tr>
  <th>A<th>B<th>A --> B
 <tr>
  <td class=falsy><td class=falsy><td class=truthy>
 <tr>
  <td class=falsy><td class=truthy><td class=truthy>
 <tr>
  <td class=truthy><td class=falsy><td><bclass=falsy></b>
 <tr>
  <td class=truthy><td class=truthy><td class=truthy>
</table>
<p>
Here are two picture as before, but with shading to show the areas
where the statement <code>bird x --&gt; wings x</code> is true.
First one where it is true everywhere:
<p>
<canvas id=birdWingsTrue width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
And now one where the statement is not true everywhere:
<p>
<canvas id=birdWingsFalse width=210 height=210></canvas>
<p>
The birds without wings are represented by the small white area with
no shading.
<p>
So we have found that it is possible to define a
function <code>implies</code> (alternatively <code>--&gt;</code>) that
enables us to make statements that say one thing implies another.  It
works like <code>and</code> and <code>or</code>, taking two boolean
values as inputs and producing a boolean (<code>true</code>
or <code>false</code>) result.

<h4>Vacuous statements</h4>
<p>
Some peculiar situations lead to results that may seem a bit strange.
What if we say that all birds larger than elephants can fly in outer
space?  If there are no birds larger than elephants in our world, in
mathematics this is considered a true statement!  The reason it is
considered true is that indeed there are <i>no examples that break
the rule</i>, that is no birds that are larger than elephants and
cannot fly in outer space!
<p>
In situations where there is nothing with a property <code>A</code>,
it is true to say that <code>A</code> implies anything at all, no
matter how silly or impossible.  Mathematicians recognize that this is
a strange situation and refer to such as statements as <i>vacuously
true</i>, meaning true but useless because there can never be a
counterexample and it doesn't matter what the conclusion of the
statement is.
