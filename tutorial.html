<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
<b>About the notation.</b> 
Aside from variables and constants, the language has only function
calls and function expressions, like lambda expressions in the lambda
calculus.  The parser and printer support infix operators, which are
"<a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Currying">curried</a>"
in the internal representation into functions of a single argument.
<p>
<b>infix operators.</b>
Infix operators available in order of increasing precedence are:
<ul>
<li><code>==</code> (equality)
<li><code>--></code> (implication)
<li><code>||</code> (or)
<li><code>&&</code> (and)
<li><code>= != &lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;=</code> (relational operators
    with equality again)
<li><code>+ -</code>
<li><code>* /</code>
</ul>
<p>
<b><code>&#x22A2;</code> and hypotheses.</b>
The turnstile symbol <code>&#x22A2;</code>
means that the items to its left are hypotheses and the expression on
the right is proved with the hypotheses assumed.  In the Prooftoys
logic, the turnstile has exactly the same meaning as the implication
symbol <code>--></code>, though some rules of inference operate
somewhat differently when there are hypotheses, focusing on the part
of the formula after the turnstile symbol.
<p>
The comma-separated expressions before a turnstile are the hypotheses
for the line.  The expressions are really a conjunction, and if you
see an integer <code>n</code> (e.g. <code>1</code> or
<code>22</code>) there, it is an abbreviation for "the term assumed in
line <code>n</code>.  The abbreviations help keep the proof lines from
sprawling all over the place.
<p>
<b>function calls.</b>
Ordinary function calls look like <code><b>(f x)</b></code> or
<code><b>f x</b></code>, and have higher precedence than any infix
operator.
<p>
<b>not.</b>
Boolean negation is represented by <code>not</code>, and is called
like any other ordinary function.
<p>
<b>anonymous functions.</b>
These have the form <code><b>{x. p x}</b></code>, a
notation somewhat resembling the Ruby programming language notation
for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)#Blocks_and_iterators"
 target="_blank">blocks</a>/anonymous functions or Smalltalk blocks.
This notation also resembles common notation for sets,
and can be read that way for functions with boolean values &mdash;
"<i>the set of x such that p of x</i>".
<p>
<b>For more information.</b>
See the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/jlogic/wiki/LanguageSummary">
language summary</a> in the project Wiki.

<h2>Sample proofs</h2>
<p>
Examples of many of the currently-implemented rules of inference are
available here.  Selecting a theorem or inference rule below displays
an example of usage of the rule or theorem.  Axioms, theorems, and
rules of inference often have parameters.
<p>
Some often-used practical rules of inference are universal
generalization (addForall), universal instantiation (instForall), and
reasoning by cases (cases).  There is a tautology checker which can
prove arbitrary tautologies, and a version of Professor Andrews' very
own Rule P.
<p>
To see how a rule operates internally, click on its name in the proof
line that uses it.
<p>
Note: <i>Proof displays are supported in recent versions of Firefox and Chrome.</i>

<h2>Proof Builder</h2>

<h3>About the Interactive Proof Builder</h3>
<p>
The proof builder lets you interactively build proofs using all of the
publicly-available theorems and rules of inference.  It can make
working with proofs easier, apply rules of inference correctly,
show what inference rules do and how they work.

<h3>Using the Proof Builder</h3>
<p>
To start, click on the text entry field.  It will pop up a menu of all
axioms, theorems, and theorem schemas available.  You can start typing
the name you want or select it from the list.  Clicking on the desired
item or typing &lt;Enter&gt; when it is selected will choose it.
<p>
Once you have chosen the axiom or theorem to use, the system checks
whether it takes parameters.  If so, you will be offered a small form
to fill in.  Enter expressions in the language as needed and type
&lt;Enter&gt; to submit the form.  The system will prove the theorem
as needed and display it in the proof.  A common first step in solving
a math problem is to use the <code>assume</code> theorem schema.  Type
any expression, and it will be "assumed" for you.  The "assume"
theorem just says that your assumption implies itself, but the rules
of inference work well with this starting point.
<p>
Once there is at least one step in your proof you can choose rules of
inference that take existing proof steps as input.  To use a rule of
inference, <i>select a step</i> that it depends on.  If a rule of
inference operates on a specific location in a step, you
must <i>select the subexpression</i> to operate on.  For example
rules <code>r</code> and <code>replace</code> require you to select
the subexpression you want to replace.  Click again on a step to
deselect it, to enter an axiom or theorem.

<h3>Building a proof using modus ponens</h3>
<p>
Let us consider a very simple example applying modus ponens to a pair of
assumptions.  Here is a display of the proof you are going to build.
<p>
<div id=modusPonens></div>
<p>
In the Proof Builder area below, you can create the same proof.
To enter an assumption click in the text entry field and
select the "assume" rule.  Type in "p", and press &lt;Enter&gt;.  You
will see the first line of your proof.
<p>
Next use the "assume" rule again, typing in "p --> q" as your second
assumption.
<p>
For the inference step, click on the first line of the proof display
anywhere outside the formula itself.  The line will highlight itself
and stay highlighted as you move the mouse away.  Now click on the
text entry field.  Since you have selected a proof step it will offer
a number of rules of inference rather than axioms and theorem schemas.
When you select "modusPonens" from the list, a small form will appear
with "1" as the "hypothesis step".  Enter "2" as the number of the
implication step to apply the rule to, and press &lt;Enter&gt;.  You
should see the modus ponens line added to the proof.
<p>
Finally to make the hypotheses explicit, you might wish to select the
last line of the proof and choose the "asImplication" rule, which
causes the hypotheses to be displayed explicitly as preconditions.
<p>
Going beyond what is displayed in the sample, you could choose the
rule "addForall" to add universal quantifiers to the formula.  You can
do this twice to quantify over both <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>.
