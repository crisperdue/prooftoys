<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
This tutorial introduces you to the language used in the Prooftoys
system, viewing and exploring proofs, and using the interactive proof
builder.

<h2>The language</h2>
<p>
For more complete information see the
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/prooftoys/wiki/LanguageSummary">
language documentation</a> in the project Wiki.
<p>
<b>About the notation.</b> 
Aside from variables and constants, the language has only function
calls and function expressions, like lambda expressions in the lambda
calculus.  The parser and printer support infix operators, which are
"<a href="http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Currying">curried</a>"
in the internal representation into functions of a single argument.
<p>
<b>infix operators.</b>
Infix operators available in order of increasing precedence are:
<ul>
<li><code>==</code> (equality, displays as "<code>&#x21d4;</code>")
<li><code>==></code> (implication, displays as "<code>&rArr;</code>")
<li><code>|</code> (or)
<li><code>&</code> (and)
<li><code>!= &lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;=</code>
(relational operators with equality again)<br>
These display as <span class=math>&ne; &lt; &le; &gt; &ge;</span> respectively.
<li><code>+ -</code>
<li><code>* /</code>
</ul>
<p>
<b>forall and exists.</b>
These are entered as <code>forall</code> and <code>exists</code>, and
display as the usual mathematical symbols
<span class=math>&forall;</span> and <span class=math>&exist;</span>.
In Prooftoys the typical math notation
<span class=math>&forall;<i>x</i> <i>P</i>(<i>x</i>)</span>
is entered as <code>forall {x. P x}</code> or
<code>forall {x. (P x)}</code> and displays as
<span class=math>&forall;{<i>x</i>. <i>P</i> <i>x</i>}</span> or
<span class=math>&forall;{<i>x</i>. (<i>P</i> <i>x</i>)}</span>.

<p>
<b><code>&#x22A2;</code> and hypotheses.</b>
The turnstile symbol <code>&#x22A2;</code> means that the items to its
left are hypotheses and the expression on the right is proved with the
hypotheses assumed.  In the Prooftoys logic, the turnstile has exactly
the same meaning as the implication symbol &rArr;
though some rules of inference operate somewhat differently when there
are hypotheses, focusing on the part of the formula after the
turnstile symbol.
<p>
The hypotheses are written as before the turnstile, as a list
separated by commas.  They are really a conjunction so you can imagine
replacing each comma with <code>&amp;&amp;</code>.  If a hypothesis is
written as just an integer (e.g. <code>1</code> or <code>22</code>)
there, it is an abbreviation for "the term assumed in line
<code>n</code>.  The abbreviations help keep the proof lines from
sprawling all over the page.
<p>
<b>function calls.</b>
Ordinary function calls look like <code><b>(f x)</b></code> or
<code><b>f x</b></code>, and have higher precedence than any infix
operator.
<p>
<b>not.</b>
Boolean negation is represented by <code>not</code>, and is called
like any other ordinary function.
<p>
<b>anonymous functions.</b>
These have the form <code><b>{x. p x}</b></code>, a
notation somewhat resembling the Ruby programming language notation
for
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_(programming_language)#Blocks_and_iterators"
 target="_blank">blocks</a>/anonymous functions or Smalltalk blocks.
This notation also resembles common notation for sets,
and can be read that way for functions with boolean values &mdash;
"<i>the set of x such that p of x</i>".

<h2>Inference in Prooftoys</h2>
<p>
Prooftoys supports the usual forms of classical inference and has a
number of common rules predefined (though not yet inference with
existential quantifiers).
<p>
Its one fundamental rule of inference is the Q<sub>0</sub> Rule R that
allows replacement of any occurrence of a term by a term that is equal
to it.  The Prooftoys "replace" rule is the same as the Q<sub>0</sub>
derived Rule R', which does the same sort of replacement when the
equation is conditional.  In other words it allows <span
class=math>C</span> to be replaced by <span class=math>D</span> if
<span class="math">H &rArr; C = D</span> or in the notation for
hypotheses, <span class="math">H1, H2, ..., Hn &#x22A2; C = D</span>.
It turns out that equations in basic textbook algebra problems
have this form when written out in full, which makes this rule
especially useful.  See the section
<a href="real-numbers.html">Working with Real Numbers</a>.

<h2>Viewing and exploring proofs</h2>
<p>
Examples of many of the currently-implemented rules of inference are
available here.  Selecting a theorem or inference rule below displays
an example of usage of the rule or theorem.  Axioms, theorems, and
rules of inference often have parameters.
<p>
Some often-used practical rules of inference are universal
generalization (addForall), universal instantiation (instForall), and
reasoning by cases (cases).  There is a tautology checker which can
prove arbitrary tautologies, and a version of Professor Andrews' very
own Rule P.
<p>
To see how a rule operates internally, click on its name in the proof
line that uses it.
<p>
Note: <i>Proof displays are supported in recent versions of Firefox and Chrome.</i>

<h2 style="margin-top: 2em">Using the proof builder</h2>

<p>
The proof builder lets you interactively build proofs using all of the
publicly-available theorems and rules of inference.  It can make
working with proofs easier, apply rules of inference correctly,
show what inference rules do and how they work.
<p>
To start, click on the text entry field.  It will pop up a menu of all
axioms, theorems, and theorem schemas available.  You can start typing
the name you want or select it from the list.  Clicking on the desired
item or typing &lt;Enter&gt; when it is selected will choose it.
<p>
Once you have chosen the axiom or theorem to use, the system checks
whether it takes parameters.  If so, you will be offered a small form
to fill in.  Enter expressions in the language as needed and type
&lt;Enter&gt; to submit the form.  The system will prove the theorem
as needed and display it in the proof.  A common first step in solving
a math problem is to use the <code>assume</code> theorem schema.  Type
any expression, and it will be "assumed" for you.  The "assume"
theorem just says that your assumption implies itself, but the rules
of inference work well with this starting point.
<p>
Once there is at least one step in your proof you can choose rules of
inference that take existing proof steps as input.  To use a rule of
inference, <i>select a step</i> that it depends on.  If a rule of
inference operates on a specific location in a step, you
must <i>select the subexpression</i> to operate on.  For example
rules <code>r</code> and <code>replace</code> require you to select
the subexpression you want to replace.  Click again on a step to
deselect it, to enter an axiom or theorem.

<h3>Building a proof using modus ponens</h3>
<p>
Let us consider a very simple example applying modus ponens to a pair of
assumptions.  Here is a display of the proof you are going to build.
<p>
<div id=modusPonens></div>
<p>
In the Proof Builder area below, you can create the same proof.
To enter an assumption click in the text entry field and
select the "assume" rule.  Type in "p", and press &lt;Enter&gt;.  You
will see the first line of your proof.
<p>
Next use the "assume" rule again, typing in <code>p ==> q</code> as
your second assumption.
<p>
For the inference step, click on the first line of the proof display
anywhere outside the formula itself.  The line will highlight itself
and stay highlighted as you move the mouse away.  Now click on the
text entry field.  Since you have selected a proof step it will offer
a number of rules of inference rather than axioms and theorem schemas.
When you select "modusPonens" from the list, a small form will appear
with "1" as the "hypothesis step".  Enter "2" as the number of the
implication step to apply the rule to, and press &lt;Enter&gt;.  You
should see the modus ponens line added to the proof.
<p>
Finally to make the hypotheses explicit, you might wish to select the
last line of the proof and choose the "asImplication" rule, which
causes the hypotheses to be displayed explicitly as preconditions.
<p>
Going beyond what is displayed in the sample, you could choose the
rule "addForall" to add universal quantifiers to the formula.  You can
do this twice to quantify over both <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>.
