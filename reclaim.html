Video script:

Science, technology, and today even commerce are extremely dependent on mathematics. Computer tools are essential to us in all these areas.

[[click through to Prooftoys]]

Shouldn't help with math itself be just a click away?

Like this service, available to anyone anywhere, connected to the Internet or any server with the open-source software installed:

Problems to solve.

[[show menu]]

Menus of relevant steps to take.

[[select step]]

Every step strictly correct, actually proved from basic principles by the software.

[[another step]]

Learning through practice, the user's choice, each step guided and checked and always mathematically correct.

[[do something silly]]

Not every step may take you toward a good solution, but you can never be mathematically wrong and you can always go back
and try something else.

[[delete the misstep, complete the problem]]

Until you get confirmation of the final result.

This session had a user interface tailored for skills practice. 

[[click to proof builder or similar]]

The full user interface offers more options and more detail. As in this little proof that taking the reciprocal twice gives back its nonzero input.

You have been watching a small session using Prooftoys, a simple proof assistant.
