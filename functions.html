<h1>About Functions</h1>

<p>Functions express dependencies.  A function expresses a dependency of
a value on some other values.  In the real world we encounter
situations in different places at different times and from different
points of view.  A situation has many observable or measurable values,
such as color, sound, direction, distance, quantity, duration,
temperature, odor, texture, and so on.

<p>For example, if the angle of the sun above the horizon at some
location depends on the time of year, the time of day, that angle is
a mathematical function of the time of year and the time of day.

<p>In Q<sub>0</sub> relationships are treated as functions with values
of true or false.  If objects are in a particular relationship, the
value of the relationship function is true.  If they are not in that
relationship, the value is false.
