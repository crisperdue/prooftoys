<h3>About functions</h3>

<p>Functions express the idea that some value is determined by some
other values.  Real-world situations have many observable or
measurable values, such as color, sound, direction, distance,
quantity, duration, temperature, and so on.

<p>For example, if the angle of the sun above the horizon at some
location can be determined from the time of year, the time of day,
that angle is a mathematical function of the time of year and the time
of day.

<p>In Q<sub>0</sub> relationships are treated as functions with values
of true or false.  If values of quantities have a certain
relationship, the value of the relationship function is true.  If they
are not in that relationship, the value is false.

<h3>About assignments</h3>
<p>
Assignment of values to variables is the key concept in the semantics
of classical systems of logic including Q<sub>0</sub>.  A statement
(boolean-valued expression) with free variables is considered true
iff it is true for every possible assignment of values to the free
variables.  
<p>
For example when working with the integers, a statement such as
<pre>
x &ge; 0
</pre>
is true iff it is true when x is 0, when x is 1, 2, etc..
<p>
Of course if <code>x</code> occurs more than once in a statement, all
occurrences are assigned the same value in each assignment.  That is
what it means for a variable to appear in multiple places in a
formula.  If they were not to be the same, the formula would have
variables with different names in the different places.

<h3>Rule R and assignments</h3>
<p>
When we have an equation that is true, Rule R says we can replace any
occurrence of its left-hand side with its right-hand side anywhere it
appears in any formula.
<p>
[[Consider how assignments work out.]]

<h3>Equations and assignments</h3>
<p>
An equation is true iff its left-hand side has the same value as its
right-hand side in all assignments to the equation's free variables.

<h3>Axiom 4 and capturing of free variables</h3>
<p>
All instances of Axiom 4 are equations, so the sides must have the
same values in all assignments.

[[Consider assignments to the bound variable of a function.]]

[[Consider how substitution usually works fine.]]

[[Show how capturing violates expectations.]]
