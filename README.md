## Prooftoys

Prooftoys is a visual proof assistant and
the engine behind Mathtoys (http://mathtoys.org).
The Prooftoys implementation is based on [Alonzo Church's 
simple type theory](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/type-theory-church/)
as formulated by 
[Professor Peter Andrews](http://gtps.math.cmu.edu/andrews.html)
under the name [Q0](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q_zero).
Simple type theory is suitable for construction
of most of mathematics, comparable to first-order
logic plus set theory.  It uses a minimum of
simple, understandable concepts, expressing them with
a handful of axioms and inference rules. 

Prooftoys is implemented in JavaScript running in the user's
web browser.  It is designed to be highly interactive and delivered
to users through the Web, so they can play with it instantly.
Prooftoys has a web site with pages for interacting with it
at http://prooftoys.org/.

[Mathtoys](http://mathtoys.org) is an interface to Prooftoys tuned for
working high school algebra problems.  Its unique HTML and code is also
on GitHub at http://github.com/crisperdue/mathtoys.
